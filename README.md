### **How To Communicate in one of the outrun channels:**

- `@username` -> sends a notification to a specific user` 
- `@channel` / `@here` -> sends a notification to everyone currently online
- **DO NOT** use `@channel` or `@here`  unless absolutely necessary, usually only instructors/ta's use these tools

### **Communicate privately:**

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once,privately

### **Other:**
- You can mute channels that you no longer need
- You can adjust the sound/notifications of your messages

## **Shout Outs**

Another thing we want to stress is the Shout Out. Any time one of your classmates gives you an "A-ha" moment or knocks a lab out of the park, please share it with the rest of the class on the `#seir-ec-2-21-resources` channel. It can be anything in the course, even if it's not related to the current topic, and can also be something we covered a few weeks ago.
